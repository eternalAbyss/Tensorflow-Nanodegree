# Tensorflow-nanodegree

Link to the nanodegree program is [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-with-tensorflow-nanodegree--nd230).

## Purpose

This repository is for storing all the codes related to machine learning at one place. The nanodegree program by udacity is divided into three parts that is the Supervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised Machine Learning and the Reinforcement learning modules. The repository is also similarly strcutured and the codes can easily be figured out based on the folder name.

## Machine Learning Material

The links to various resources that are needed to understand the above code will be given below:
